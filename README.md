# Machine Learning Learner for Stock Price Prediction
This project creates a machine learning model for stock price prediction. It evaluates 2 strategies to generate trade signals.

## Strategy 1 - Manual Strategy
This section links to the ManualStrategy.py code, which uses different trading indicators to determine trade signals.

## Strategy 2 - Strategic Learner
This section uses BagLearner with RTLearner as the AI model to learn trading patterns. It will use AI to generate trade signals which will be compared to strategy 1 to evaluate.
